# Overview
This repository contains the relevant information to redo the analysis in the paper. It contains all the supplementary documentation, the model code, instructions for using the code and the links to the underlying data sources that were used.

# Model philosophy
We believe in open access publications, open data and open source code. Being open and creating global public goods is key to transparent, informed and evidence based decision-making. To do so one needs to have an open and transparent framework, that allows results to be replicated.

Replicability requires a strict separation of data and calculation rules. The calculation rules are ideally written using open source tools. This is not always possible when there is proprietary software is needed for functionality not available in open-source software. GAMS (general algebraic modeling system: https://www.gams.com/) in combination with GTREE (https://www.wecr.wur.nl/gamstools/index.htm) allows us to create sparse, transparent models that meet our strict results replicability criteria, while allowing for maximum transparency.

The current model code is part of a larger endeavor for making open source data interoperable and usable for generating actionable information based on key open access data.

We apply a flexible and extensible modular framework that allows adding and updating modules while keeping track of the versions of the modules. The approach makes a strict separation between calculation rules, underlying data and the user defined switches that steer the model framework.
